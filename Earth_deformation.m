function [ n, e, u ] = Earth_deformation( fi0, la0, green_fun, Hydrology_model )
%
% function Earth_deformation is used to calculate crustal deformations
% as a response to hydrosphere loading
%
% fi0, la0          latitude and longitude of calculated deformations,
%                   input as decimal degrees
%
% green_fun         Green's function coefficients defining load response
%                   of Earth's crust.
%                   The data structure: 3 columns containing spherical distances
%                   to loading mass and Green's function coefficients describing
%                   deformations in radial and tangential direction.
%                   Values in 2nd and 3rd columns should contain normalized
%                   values (their de-normalization, depending on spherical
%                   earth's radius is done at runtime).
%                   Green's function coefficients for distances between the
%                   distances in the first column of the table are calculated
%                   with third degree spline
%                   
% Hydrology_model   hydrological data with spatial resolution of
%                   0.5 degree (one month includes 360 rows and 720 columns)
%                   that assign the amount of fresh water for each cell.
%                   Data should express height of water column for each cell
%                   in millimetres. Cells without determined water quantity
%                   should be marked as NaN (Not a Number)
